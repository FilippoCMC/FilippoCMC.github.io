	abstract = {Bipolar disorder ({BD}) is a severe psychiatric condition featuring autonomic nervous system dysfunctions, detectable with abnormal heart rate variability ({HRV}). This is a promising biomarker, but its dynamics over an acute episode of mania or depression, the two polarities of {BD}, are poorly understood. Studies of intra- individual {HRV} changes in {BD} cannot afford to recruit more than only few dozen patients, as collecting this kind of data is very resource-intensive. This makes the ground treacherous for frequentist statistical analyses. Unlike previous studies, we therefore took a Bayesian approach, as more suitable for quantifying uncertainty in small samples. Specifically, we developed an interpretable probabilistic model of {HRV} changes over the course of an acute {BD} episode, using the natural logarithm of the Root Mean Square of Successive {RR} interval Differences ({lnRMSSD}) as {HRV} measure. Patients with {BD} were recruited at the onset of an acute episode, either mania or depression, and had three-to-four follow-up assessments up to euthymia. Conversely, previous studies used just two assessments, which prevents adequately modelling change. During each assessment, {lnRMSSD} sleep values were recorded with a wearable device and symptoms’ severity was assessed with clinician-administered questionnaires. A model allowing the {lnRMSSD} rate of change with respect to symptoms’ improvement to vary across polarities was no better fit than a model disregarding polarities. Strong evidence emerged for a positive {lnRMSSD} change over the episode’s resolution (probability of positive direction = 95.175\%), but sample size limited ascertaining the magnitude of this effect (95\% Highest Density Interval of [-0.0366-0.4706] with a Region of Practical Equivalence of [-0.05, 0.05]). In conclusion, improvements in {BD} symptoms are associated with an increase in {lnRMSSD} but these changes do not appear to be influenced by the episode polarity.},
