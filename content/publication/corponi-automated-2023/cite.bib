	abstract = {Mood disorders ({MDs}) are among the leading causes of disease burden worldwide. Limited specialized care availability remains a major bottleneck thus hindering pre-emptive interventions. {MDs} manifest with changes in mood, sleep, and motor activity, observable in ecological physiological recordings thanks to recent advances in wearable technology. Therefore, near-continuous and passive collection of physiological data from wearables in daily life, analyzable with machine learning ({ML}), could mitigate this problem, bringing {MDs} monitoring outside the clinician’s office. Previous works predict a single label, either the disease state or a psychometric scale total score. However, clinical practice suggests that the same label may underlie different symptom profiles, requiring specific treatments. Here we bridge this gap by proposing a new task: inferring all items in {HDRS} and {YMRS}, the two most widely used standardized scales for assessing {MDs} symptoms, using physiological data from wearables. To that end, we develop a deep learning pipeline to score the symptoms of a large cohort of {MD} patients and show that agreement between predictions and assessments by an expert clinician is clinically significant (quadratic Cohen’s κ and macro-average F1 score both of 0.609). While doing so, we investigate several solutions to the {ML} challenges associated with this task, including multi-task learning, class imbalance, ordinal target variables, and subject-invariant representations. Lastly, we illustrate the importance of testing on out-of-distribution samples.},
