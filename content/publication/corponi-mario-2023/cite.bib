	abstract = {Personal sensing, leveraging data passively and near-continuously collected with wearables from patients in their ecological environment, is a promising paradigm to monitor mood disorders ({MDs}), a major determinant of worldwide disease burden. However, collecting and annotating wearable data is very resource-intensive. Studies of this kind can thus typically afford to recruit only a couple dozens of patients. This constitutes one of the major obstacles to applying modern supervised machine learning techniques to {MDs} detection. In this paper, we overcome this data bottleneck and advance the detection of {MDs} acute episode vs stable state from wearables data on the back of recent advances in self-supervised learning ({SSL}). This leverages unlabelled data to learn representations during pre-training, subsequently exploited for a supervised task. First, we collected open-access datasets recording with an Empatica E4 spanning different, unrelated to {MD} monitoring, personal sensing tasks -- from emotion recognition in Super Mario players to stress detection in undergraduates -- and devised a pre-processing pipeline performing on-/off-body detection, sleep-wake detection, segmentation, and (optionally) feature extraction. With 161 E4-recorded subjects, we introduce E4SelfLearning, the largest to date open access collection, and its pre-processing pipeline. Second, we show that {SSL} confidently outperforms fully-supervised pipelines using either our novel E4-tailored Transformer architecture (E4mer) or classical baseline {XGBoost}: 81.23\% against 75.35\% (E4mer) and 72.02\% ({XGBoost}) correctly classified recording segments from 64 (half acute, half stable) patients. Lastly, we illustrate that {SSL} performance is strongly associated with the specific surrogate task employed for pre-training as well as with unlabelled data availability.},
